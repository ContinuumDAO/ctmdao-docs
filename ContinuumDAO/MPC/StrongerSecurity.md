## Stronger Security

TEE, or Trusted Execution Environment, helps identify software versions to block malicious participants and secure private key shards.

**Proactive Security Strategy:** To enhance security, we regularly rotate the private key shards of nodes. This process is designed to be forward compatible, meaning it doesn't disrupt ongoing operations and remains transparent. For instance, in the rare event that a malicious participant manages to gather some private key shards, these will become useless after we rotate them, thus safeguarding the systemâ€™s integrity.
