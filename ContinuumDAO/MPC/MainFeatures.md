## Main Features

The implementation and security of the MPC protocol are ensured by a series of cryptographic protocols, including secret sharing, homomorphic encryption, commitment schemes, and zero-knowledge proof technologies. This distributed private key management scheme greatly enhances both the decentralization and security of the system while avoiding single points of failure. It features:

#### 1. Decentralization

The private key is jointly held by multiple participants without a single centralized control point. The setting of thresholds aligns with the essence of blockchain, which relies on the consensus of the majority of nodes.

#### 2. Security

Even if some nodes are compromised, as long as the threshold is not met, the private key cannot be fully disclosed. It also allows for proactive distributed key updates before malicious attackers collect enough private key fragments.

#### 3. High Compatibility and Scalability

Compatible with over 95% of blockchains, whether EVM or non-EVM. It can dynamically adjust the number of nodes participating in signing and the threshold values, ensuring forward compatibility (i.e., the public key remains unchanged before and after threshold adjustments).
