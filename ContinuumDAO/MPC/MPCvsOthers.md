## MPC vs Others

The blockchain market is flourishing, bolstered by ongoing investments from the capital markets and continuous innovations from the technical community. These efforts are advancing blockchain technology to support widespread commercial applications.

Presently, to improve security and decentralization, several technical solutions are being widely discussed and explored. These include Multi-Party Computation (MPC), zero-knowledge proofs, and multi-signature schemes. Each technology has unique features and benefits, and following thorough technical debates and testing, many are moving towards practical deployment and use.

In this section, we will delve into a detailed explanation and comparison of these technologies, highlighting the specific advantages of our MPC technology.
