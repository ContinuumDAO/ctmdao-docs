## Introduction

The essential service that ContinuumDAO will offer is a state of the art peer-to-peer
node network that will connect blockchains. Each node will join a set of others to
collectively sign transactions using a Secure Multiple Party Computation (SMPC) based
Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS).

The nodes, collectively known as the Continuum, will form a core part of web3
architecture for other protocols to use for applications such as a router, cross-chain
messages, and NFT bridges. They will allow all EVMs and almost all non-EVMs to
connect. The SMPC scheme will utilise the latest threshold signature algorithms, with a 
lot of pre-computation, to deliver the fastest MPC network and larger signature than other SMPC schemes, providing extra security.

The Continuum will be of use whenever many parties must agree upon something before it can happen, or when a single party wishes to only trust a transaction collectively signed by a group. The cryptographic algorithm will ensure that no parties can cheat. This has obvious applications in the field of finance (e.g. jointly signing transactions), but in fact will be useful in many other spheres, when for something important to happen, several parties must agree, or one party wants to execute without trusting individuals.

The Continuum is a pure piece of architecture, which can be used by many applications built on top of it. ContinuumDAO does not have allegence to anyone, any company or protocol. It is a DAO controlled through voting by its token holders.
