## Introduction


ContinuumDAO will offer an essential service: a state-of-the-art peer-to-peer node network that provides a compliant RWA issuance platform, for both Securities and non-Securities. This will open up the world of DeFi to investors, with full interoperability between any blockchain. 

Our smart contracts have full multi-chain inter-operability with many EVMs and non-EVMs to enable value transfer and staking of RWAs in lending protocols on any blockchain as collateral. Thus, the assets can continue to earn dividend yield and lending yield, or the underlying liquidity can be freed up for use in the wider DeFi world. 

This technology runs on the Continuum network, built using Secure Multiple Party Computation (SMPC) and secured with Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) at its core. It runs on a peer-to-peer node network that collectively signs transactions.

The nodes, collectively known as the Continuum, will form a core part of web3 architecture for other protocols to use for applications such as the AssetX RWA tokenization platform, our router, cross-chain messages, and value exchange and interaction between diverse token contracts, including RWAs and more. They will allow all EVMs and almost all non-EVMs to connect.

The Continuum will be used whenever an agreement on the network needs to be reached before a transaction can happen or when a single party wishes only to trust a transaction collectively signed by a specific group. The cryptographic algorithm incorporated in Continuum will ensure that no parties can act maliciously.

As a key part of our architecture, ContinuumDAO acts as an independent controller of the protocol, which does not have allegiance to any person, company, or protocol. It is a DAO controlled through voting by token holders.
