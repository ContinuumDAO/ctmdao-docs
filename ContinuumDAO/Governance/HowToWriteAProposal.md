## How to Write a Proposal

ContinuumDAO is entirely controlled by veCTM holders. veCTM holders have full governance rights in ContinuumDAO including controlling the Treasury. All proposals need to go through a three-step process as described below. When a proposal is passed, the changes will either be implemented directly through an on-chain smart contract call, or by the Committee signing the multi-sig, if necessary to transfer funds, or make changes to smart contracts.


We are delighted to welcome all veCTM holders to participate in shaping ContinuumDAO's future. If you’d like to submit a proposal, please follow the steps below.


### Phase 1: Discussion

The genesis of your proposal idea could be in ContinuumDAO’s Telegram channel, but please initiate discussion in the [Forum](https://forum.continuumdao.org/). This could be in the [Ideas & Suggestions](https://forum.continuumdao.org/category/2/ideas-suggestions) section or in one of the Guilds in the Forum. From there, you should collect feedback from the community and then use this to create your draft proposal. You may get some feedback from the Committee also - all designed to help you create a good proposal. 

### Phase 2: Temperature Check (TC)

After the discussion period, which could take a few days or a week or two you can post your draft proposal to the Proposals - Treasury, or Proposals - Constitution sections of the Governance section of the Forum. Label it NNNN - Temperature Check *Title of Proposal*, where NNNN is the next sequential proposal number.

There is no threshold to propose for the Temperature Check. Proposals will have a Temperature Check for 5 days. Once the proposal collects enough feedback (more than twice as many veCTM holders commented positively for the proposal as did negatively and at least 10 veCTM holders commented) from the community, the authors can make changes to the proposal to incorporate the comments from the community, if they wish to. The proposal is now ready for the next stage, which is a Formal Vote.

### Phase 3: Formal Vote (FV)

At this stage, the proposal author(s) should contact one of the Committee members. They will need to verify that the proposer’s wallet address has at least 1% of the vote power. This can be their own voting power, or can include voting power delegated to it via the Governance contract.
Once the 1% vote power threshold has been passed, the Committee will check that the proposal has the correct format (see below), with no omissions and then it will be posted to either snapshot.org or tally.xyx (on-chain governance). The voting period will be 10 days


## Proposal Format

Follow the proposal template below and make sure that it has all of these elements please:

#### Proposal Template

**Abstract** (summary of no more than 200 words)

**Motivation** (what do your team hope to achieve?)
Specification

**Overview** (please include the background of who you and your team are)

**Type of proposal** (choose from : Constitution or Request for funding)

**Scope** (define the breakdown of the tasks in the project as a list)
Success Criteria (for Treasury Proposals) - Deliverables and Milestones

**Timeline** (you could use a Gantt Chart for a larger project)

**Budget** (include amounts to be paid upon some Deliverables, or Milestones achieved)


#### Necessary Elements of an Effective Proposal

**Clear Objectives**
A well-structured proposal should begin by clearly stating its objectives. What problem does it aim to solve, or what opportunity does it seek to capitalize on? Clarity in objectives is essential for communities to understand the proposal's purpose.

**Comprehensive Details**
Proposals should provide in-depth information, including a breakdown of the budget, timelines, and expected outcomes.

**Alignment with ContinuumDAO Goals**
Proposals should align with the DAO's Mission and Vision as detailed in the Constitution. They should demonstrate how the proposal contributes to the overall objectives of ContinuumDAO and its community.

**Community Involvement**
Encourage community engagement by soliciting feedback and collaboration on your proposal before submission, which can lead to valuable insights and improvements.



**Note** 
The Committee has the right to initiate a vote if it’s needed, without going through phase 1 and phase 2.
