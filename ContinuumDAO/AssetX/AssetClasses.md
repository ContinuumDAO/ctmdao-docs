## Adding Asset Classes

Each RWA can have any number of Asset Classes (or slots). Their meaning is completely up to the Issuer to decide, but typically they are used to differentiate between related but different offerings within the same RWA. The Asset Classes could be for different interest rates, different equity classes, different grades of a product etc.

Here in our example, we choose to define different classes of equity

You click on the component of the RWA on the chain that you wish to add the Asset Class from. If you are not currently connected to this chain, you will be prompted to "Switch chain". You then describe the Asset Class (256 character limit), which is given the next slot number and you assign "Units" to it (can be blank).

You then click "Create Slot"

The slot will appear within seconds on the currently connected chain, but will take a few minutes (up to 20 minutes) to appear on the other chains in the RWA as the cross-chain signatures are completed by the MPC node network. Please wait patiently until you see the Asset Class appear on the other chains
