## Deploying an RWA

It is assumed that you are now in AssetX (https://factory.AssetX.org), that you have connected a wallet, that you have connected to the chain you wish to deploy an RWA from and that you have gas in your wallet. If not, please see Getting Started.

Then you can fill out the "name", "symbol" and "decimals"

The name should be between 10 and 100 characters in length

The symbol should be between 1 and 6 characters in length and capitalized

The decimals refers to how many decimal places you are reserving when describing fractional assets. For instance if decimals = 0, only whole integer numbers of the asset can be minted and exchanged. The use of decimals = 18 is common amongst ERC20 type assets.

You can now select which chains you want to deploy the RWA to by clicking on the boxes next to the chains. The current chain is automatically selected
