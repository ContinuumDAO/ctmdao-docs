## Transferring Value

You can transfer value from any slot in an RWA that is owned by your wallet to another wallet as long as Whitelisting or KYC/KYB has not been enabled by the Issuer (Token Admin). If these have been enabled, then the wallet address you wish to transfer value to must have been added to the Whitelist.

You can send value to an address on the same chain, or to any other chain that the RWA has been deployed to. You cannot transfer value between different Asset Classes (slots).

Here we will transfer some of Ordinary Equity tokens from Arbitrum to Avalanche. If we had omitted the "value", the entire balance would have been transferred.
