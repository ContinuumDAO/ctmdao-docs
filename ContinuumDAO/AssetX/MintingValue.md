## Minting Value in Asset Classes

Once the different Asset Classes in an RWA have been created, the Issuer (or Token Admin) can mint "value" to them. Once they have done this, they can distribute the tokens to "holders" or sell them.

The minting occurs on the chain that is currently connected. The Issuer selects the Asset Class they wish to mint to and define how many they wish to mint. Here we mint some value to slot 0 on Arbitrum Sepolia by clicking on this :-

Then click "Mint"

and the tokens appear in the "RWA Token Held" section, alongside other tokens held by this wallet :-

We can then click on the slot 1 "2 Year Vested Equity" Asset Class on BSC Testnet chain. We are prompted to switch chains to BSC, which we do and then we can mint some value to slot 1 and these appear in the tokens held too :-

It can be seen that the new tokens are not "Locked"

The Issuer can continue to mint new value to each of the Asset Classes, usually when the new tokens are backed by new "real" assets. An example of this could be if new property is acquired, or if the Issuer simply wishes to dilute the value of the existing holders.

At some point the Issuer may wish to "Lock" the RWA. The consequence of this is that no new value can be minted, or new chains added, or new Asset Classes added. The Issuer no longer has any access to the RWA.
